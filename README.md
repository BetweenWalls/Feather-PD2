# Feather-PD2
Simple Lootfilter for Project Diablo II

## Overview
This filter is a modified version of my [Feather](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/Feather) filter. Very few items are hidden.

## Features
* mostly follows classic style (it still looks like D2)
* non-equipment more clearly distinguished from equipment (gems, jewels, charms)
* unique/set/other items highlighted based on their usefulness
* natural sockets shown for unidentified unique/set items
* regular items displayed with amount of skills and highest skill value
* enhanced damage/defense shown for superior items
* popular crafting ingredients marked with codified recipes
* shopping for valuable items from merchants made easier
* notifications for valuable items

### Hidden Items:
* smaller gold piles
* low-level potions
* low-level gems
* scrolls
* keys
* regular items that have zero use for runewords
* regular skill-capable items without skills
* magic non-elite items without lasting usefulness
* some additional regular/magic items (minimal usefulness) in maps

## Installation
Download **loot.filter** and save it to your *Diablo II\ProjectD2* folder.
