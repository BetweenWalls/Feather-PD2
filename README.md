# Feather-PD2
Lootfilter for Project Diablo II

This is a minimally-strict filter that includes many quality-of-life features. Very few items are hidden, but enough is hidden that the onscreen-item-limit rarely comes into play (even in maps).

## Features
* mostly follows classic style (it still looks like D2)
* non-equipment more clearly distinguished from equipment (gems, jewels, charms)
* items highlighted based on their usefulness
* notifications for valuable items
* unidentified unique/set items displayed with sockets (if applicable)
* regular items displayed with amount of skills and highest skill value
* superior items displayed with enhanced damage/defense
* shopping for valuable items made easier
* descriptions for socketed effects on stacked gems/runes
* descriptions for upgrading recipes where appropriate
* descriptions for crafting recipes
* descriptions for possible runewords
* descriptions for maximum possible sockets on 0-socket regular items (if lower than usual)
* descriptions for item price on regular/magic/rare items

### Hidden Items:
* smaller gold piles
* low-level potions
* low-level gems
* scrolls
* keys
* arrows/bolts
* regular items that have zero use for runewords
* regular skill-capable items without skills
* some of the worst equipment bases as the character levels up
