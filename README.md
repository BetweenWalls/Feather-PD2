# Feather-PD2
Lootfilter for Project Diablo II

This is a minimally-strict filter that includes many quality-of-life features. Very few items are hidden.

## Features
* mostly follows classic style (it still looks like D2)
* non-equipment more clearly distinguished from equipment (gems, jewels, charms)
* unique/set items highlighted based on their usefulness
* natural sockets shown for unidentified unique/set items
* regular items displayed with amount of skills and highest skill value
* enhanced damage/defense shown for superior items
* shopping for valuable items made easier
* descriptions for upgrading/crafting recipes and possible runewords where appropriate
* descriptions for stacked gems/runes showing effects-when-socketed
* notifications for valuable items

### Hidden Items:
* smaller gold piles
* low-level potions
* low-level gems
* scrolls
* keys
* arrows/bolts
* regular items that have zero use for runewords
* regular skill-capable items without skills
* some of the worst equipment bases as the character levels up
